# OpenCV-Face-Recognition
 This project was done with this fantastic "Open Source Computer Vision Library", the OpenCV. On this tutorial, we will be focusing on Raspberry Pi (so, Raspbian as OS) and Python, but I also tested the code on My Mac and it also works fine. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. So, it's perfect for real-time face recognition using a camera.
